# Traffic Simulation in Unity

Welcome to the Traffic Simulation Unity project! This repository contains the source code for a dynamic traffic simulation system built using Unity. The simulation aims to model realistic traffic flow on grid-based road networks, featuring comprehensive car paths, traffic light logic, and vehicle interactions.

## Features

- **Grid-Based Road Generation:** Roads are dynamically generated in a grid pattern, allowing for a complex network of intersections and paths for vehicles to navigate.
- **Traffic Light Logic:** Implements realistic traffic light controls, managing the flow of vehicles through intersections to mimic real-world traffic signal behavior.
- **Vehicle Interactions:** Detailed vehicle-to-vehicle interaction logic to simulate realistic driving behaviors, including stopping for red lights and yielding to other vehicles.
- **Red Light Interaction:** Cars react to traffic lights, stopping at red signals and proceeding when green, to ensure smooth traffic flow and prevent accidents at intersections.

## Live Demo

Experience the traffic simulation firsthand! The simulation is hosted and available for you to interact with. Visit the [Traffic Simulation WebGL Demo](https://sarang997.github.io/simulationWebGL/).

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- Unity Editor (Version 2020.3 LTS or later recommended)
- Git

### Installation
